## Temporarily disabled homepage sections
The following homepage components have been commented out in `index.html` for potential reuse:

- Achievements counter block
- Action Resources cards (`{% include causes.html %}`)
- Upcoming Activities carousel (`{% include events.html %}`)
- Latest News blog grid
- Our Work gallery (`{% include gallery.html %}`)
