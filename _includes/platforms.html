            <p class="mb-4">Two cross-cutting committees keep the Action agile and inclusive. They connect Working Groups, the Core Group, and the Management Committee, translating strategy into hands-on support for members and stakeholders.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The platforms track Action-wide KPIs, coordinate joint initiatives, and ensure outcomes are visible both within the COST network and to external partners. They are also the main entry point for members seeking logistical guidance or communication support.</p>
