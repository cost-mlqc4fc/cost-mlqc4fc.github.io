heading: Accelerating Future Collider studies with Machine Learning and Quantum Computing
intro: >
  MLQC4FC connects European expertise in Machine Learning (ML), Quantum Computing (QC), Particle Physics, Collider Technologies, and Data Infrastructures to accelerate innovation towards the next-generation particle physics colliders.
intro_long: >
  Launched under COST Action CA24146, MLQC4FC coordinates researchers, engineers, and
  industry partners who are rethinking the computational backbone of future collider
  experiments. By combining cutting-edge machine learning workflows with emerging quantum
  computing paradigms, the Action builds common roadmaps, demonstrators, and training
  opportunities that benefit the entire high-energy physics community.

    label: Objectives
    title: Strategic objectives
    body: >
      We map the state of the art in Machine Learning and Quantum Computing for collider
      applications, identify priority R&D challenges, develop open benchmarks and software
      demonstrators, and back these efforts with training schools, short-term scientific
      missions, and inclusive networking grants.
