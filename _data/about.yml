heading: Accelerating Future Collider studies with Machine Learning and Quantum Computing
intro: >
  MLQC4FC connects European expertise in Machine Learning (ML), Quantum Computing (QC), Particle Physics, Collider Technologies, and Data Infrastructures to accelerate innovation towards the next-generation particle physics colliders.
intro_long: >
  Launched under COST Action CA24146, MLQC4FC coordinates researchers, engineers, and
  industry partners who are rethinking the computational backbone of future collider
  experiments. By combining cutting-edge machine learning workflows with emerging quantum
  computing paradigms, the Action builds common roadmaps, demonstrators, and training
  opportunities that benefit the entire high-energy physics community.

      We provide a common forum where collider physicists, computer scientists, and
      quantum technology specialists can co-design solutions. The Action aligns national
      efforts, shares best practices, and ensures that breakthroughs in computation
      translate into real detector and analysis capabilities.

    title: Strategic objectives
    body: >
      We map the state of the art in machine learning and quantum computing for collider
      applications, identify priority R&D challenges, develop open benchmarks and software
      demonstrators, and back these efforts with training schools, short-term scientific
      missions, and inclusive networking grants.

    title: An open, collaborative network
    body: >
      Membership is open to researchers from COST Member Countries, Near Neighbour
      Countries, and international partner institutions. Working Groups meet regularly,
      the Core Group monitors progress, and targeted platforms for young researchers and
      inclusiveness target countries keep the network vibrant.
