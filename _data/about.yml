heading: Accelerating Future Collider studies with Machine Learning and Quantum Computing
intro: >
  MLQC4FC connects European expertise in Machine Learning (ML), Quantum Computing (QC), Particle Physics, Collider Technologies, and Data Infrastructures to accelerate innovation towards the next-generation particle physics colliders.
intro_long: >
  Launched under COST Action CA24146, MLQC4FC coordinates researchers, engineers, and
  industry partners who are rethinking the computational backbone of future collider
  experiments. By combining cutting-edge machine learning workflows with emerging quantum
  computing paradigms, the Action builds common roadmaps, demonstrators, and training
  opportunities that benefit the entire high-energy physics community.

    title: A European hub for ML and QC in collider physics
    body: >
      We provide a common forum where collider physicists, computer scientists, and
      quantum technology specialists can collaborate to shape the future of particle accelerators and experiments. 
      The Action aligns national efforts to ensure that breakthroughs in computation
      translate into real opportunities for the future of fundamental physics research.

    label: Objectives
    title: Strategic objectives
    body: >
      We map the state of the art in Machine Learning and Quantum Computing for collider
      applications, identify priority R&D challenges, develop open benchmarks and software
      demonstrators, and back these efforts with several networking opportunities: training schools, workshops, conferences, short-term scientific missions, and inclusive networking grants.
